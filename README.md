#### Overview
 This app allows customers to book the type of nail service they require. The customer will be able to manage their bookings by selecting a treatment.
 For the CRUD functionality, the user can create a login in order to book a service, which will be stored in my Customers Database. The user can view and edit     their bookings which will then be updated in database.
 
#### Project Tracking 
Initially had three relationship tables, however if would have been difficult to implement the relationship between all three, so for simplcity and due to lack of time I reduced the database to two tables.

#### Overview
 This app allows customers to book the type of nail service they require.
 There are many 10 services that they can choose from, with the duration of the service and the price of the service is given.
 I chose to do this application as it is something that I would use myself as I enjoy getting my nails done and there are amny services to choose from so a customer can choose to have more than one service at a time.

#### Overview
> This app allows customers to book the type of nail service they require.
> There are many 10 services that they can choose from, with the duration of the service and the price of the service is given.
> I chose to do this application as it is something that I would use myself as I enjoy getting my nails done and there are amny services to choose from so a customer can choose to have more than one service at a time.
